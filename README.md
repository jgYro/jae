# Just Another Editor

Kind of bored of emacs, vim and helix and general the paradigms of modal editing. I really love the idea of emacs, but at this point there's too many features from the decades of its existence I am pretty indifferent about so I decided to take a lot of inspiration from it with this editor.

## Key Ideas
- Non-modal editing
- Simple yet powerful interface
- "Operate" mode which will basically be like https://cribl.io in a box when operating on text
- Advanced binary analysis tooling built-in
- Unix based principles leveraging external tools and STDIN and STDOUT where possible
